This repository contains an adapted version of the Marlin 2.1.x bugfix firmware for Jonathan Weiss's Printess, a low-cost, open-source direct ink writing 3D printer for soft materials.

The firmware has been modified for a BIGTREETECH Octopus Pro V1.1 with an STM32H723ZE MCU and 6 TMC2208 Stepper Motor Drivers. Three additional linear axes, (I, J, K), have been added to control two syringes and their plungers.
